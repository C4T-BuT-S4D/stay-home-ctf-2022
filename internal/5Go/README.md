The service allows you to store your private notes in a most end-to-end-encrypted way possible (even I don't fully
understand the protocol).

Interaction is possible with the python [client](./client/client.py), exploits will probably
use [daeh5](./client/daeh5.py).

You SHOULD NOT reverse-engineer anything related to the protocol, its sole purpose is to make traffic sniffing (and
exploit stealing)
harder than actually solving the service.
